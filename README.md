# MutualInformation
This provides several Mutual Information (MI) functions in Python. Currently, this provides the MI between continuous variables based on:
Kraskov, A., St√∂gbauer, H. and Grassberger, P., 2004. Estimating mutual information. Physical review E, 69(6), p.066138.

We are planning to add:
1) MI between continious variables based on binning method
2) MI between continious-discrete variables based on binning method 
2) MI between continious-discrete variables based on nearest-neigbor method
