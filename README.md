# MutualInformation
This provides several Mutual Information (MI) functions in Python. Currently, this provides the MI between continuous variables based on: 
Kraskov, A., St√∂gbauer, H. and Grassberger, P., 2004. Estimating mutual information. Physical review E, 69(6), p.066138.

We are planning to add:
1) MI between continuous variables based on binning method
2) MI between continuous-discrete variables based on binning method and others
